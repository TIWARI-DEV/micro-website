    <p>
        A computer is an electronic device derived from the Latin word "computere," which means to calculate. It accepts raw facts and figures as input, processes this information according to the commands supplied by the user, stores it before and after processing, and produces meaningful information as output through an output device. Generally, computers work on the <span class="highlight-blue">IPO (Input-Process-Output)</span> cycle and follow the <span class="highlight-blue">GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out)</span> principle, meaning the output is always based on the input supplied by the user.
    </p>

    <h2>Some Characteristics/Features of Computers</h2>
    <p>
        The use of computers is increasing day by day due to several special features:

    <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
    <p>
        The development of computers has passed through different generations:
    </p>

    <h3>1. First Generation (1946-1958)</h3>
    <p>
        Used vacuum tubes as their basic components. They were large, consumed a lot of electricity, and were prone to hardware failures. 
    </p>

    <h3>2. Second Generation (1959-1964)</h3>
    <p>
        Utilized transistors, making them smaller and more reliable than first-generation computers.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Third Generation (1965-1974)</h3>
    <p>
        Employed Integrated Circuits (ICs), resulting in faster and more reliable machines.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Fourth Generation (1975-1990)</h3>
    <p>
        Used VLSI (Very Large Scale Integrated Circuits), significantly reducing size and increasing portability.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Fifth Generation (1990-Onwards)</h3>
    <p>
        Incorporates ULSI (Ultra Large Scale Integrated Circuits) or Microprocessors and introduces artificial intelligence capabilities.
    </p>

    <h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
    <p>
        The CPU is the brain of the computer, responsible for calculations and comparisons. It consists of:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</li>
        <li>Control Unit (CU)</li>
        <li>Memory Unit (MU)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Differences Between Impact and Non-Impact Printers:</h3>

        <tr>
            <th>Impact Printer</th>
            <th>Non-Impact Printer</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Uses electro-mechanical mechanisms to strike against a ribbon and paper.</td>
            <td>Uses thermal, chemical, electrostatic, or inkjet technology for printing.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Slow while printing.</td>
            <td>Fast while printing.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Produces more sound due to the force used in printing.</td>
            <td>Produces less sound while printing.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cannot print graphics perfectly.</td>
            <td>Can print graphics perfectly.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Usually single-colored.</td>
            <td>Can be single or multi-colored.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Rarely used at present.</td>
            <td>Widely used at present.</td>
