    <p>
        Multimedia consists of two words: ‘Multi’ and ‘Media’. Where multi means many and media means a way/medium of expressing information. Hence, multimedia is the way of expressing information in different forms. The information can be expressed in text, audio, video, graphics, and animation. We use several forms of media for better understanding and effective communication. By using multimedia, any information can be illustrated in greater depth.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since a single form of media is inefficient for better communication and greater understanding, we integrate several components of multimedia (text, audio, video, animation, and graphics) using a multimedia computer system. A multimedia computer system consists of multimedia hardware and multimedia software. Printer, projector, webcam, microphone, and digital camera are some of the widely used multimedia hardware. Similarly, software like text editors (MS Word), presentation tools (PowerPoint), photo editing software (Photoshop), video editing software (iMovie), and accounting packages (Tally) are used as multimedia software. These multimedia hardware and software work together to integrate various components of multimedia. For example, a video can be created by integrating audio and images.
    </p>

    <h3>Advantages/Merits/Pros/Importance of Multimedia</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It helps to make communication much more effective.</li>
        <li>It enhances the level of understanding of any particular topic.</li>
        <li>Games, cartoons, and movies are made more effective and realistic by using multimedia.</li>
        <li>It makes the teaching and learning process much more interesting and intuitive.</li>
        <li>Virtual reality and simulation have become more realistic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages/De-merits/Cons/Limitation of Multimedia</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Multimedia components may be expensive.</li>
        <li>Technical knowledge and IT literacy are required to operate multimedia.</li>
        <li>Technology is always changing and never constant.</li>
        <li>Multimedia devices run on electricity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Components/Elements of Multimedia</h3>
    <h4>Text</h4>
    <p>
        Text is the collection of alphanumeric values or any characters. It can be a word, a single line, or a paragraph. We can create and customize text using several text editors or word processors such as MS Word and Notepad. It is the basic form of expressing information. Using multimedia software, we can customize the text by adjusting size, color, type, style, etc. Extensions of text documents include <code>.docx</code>, <code>.txt</code>, etc.
    </p>

    <h4>Graphics / Images</h4>
    <p>
        "A picture is worth a thousand words," meaning pictures can describe things more than text. Graphics generally refer to images or pictures, with the smallest element called a pixel (Picture Element). The quality of an image is denoted by the number of pixels available, generally termed as resolution. We use several multimedia software such as Adobe Photoshop, CorelDRAW, and Adobe InDesign. Extensions of images include <code>.jpeg</code>, <code>.png</code>, etc.
    </p>

    <h4>Audio</h4>
    <p>
        Audio is one of the important components of multimedia, providing the sensation of hearing. It can enhance understanding in any particular topic, and may include human voice, instrument notes, natural sounds, and digitally synthesized sounds. Audio can be transferred by converting it into digital signals. FM radio uses this component to convey information. Multimedia software such as Windows Media Player can be used to play audio. Extensions of audio files include <code>.mp3</code>, <code>.wma</code>, etc.
    </p>

    <h4>Video</h4>
    <p>
        Video consists of running frames of static pictures. It is generated by capturing a maximum number of images in a unit of time. The term "frames per second" (FPS) describes the smoothness of a video, typically 15-30 FPS for smooth movement. Various multimedia software such as iMovie, Final Cut Pro, and Filmora can be used to edit and customize video content. Extensions for video files include <code>.mp4</code>, <code>.mpeg</code>, etc.
    </p>

    <h4>Animation</h4>
    <p>
        Animation is a sequence of vector images displayed in rapid succession to provide visual effects. These images are computer-generated. Animation is created to express ideas where complex explanations should be effectively delivered. It can be either 2D or 3D, with 3D animation being more realistic. Various multimedia software such as Maya Animation, AutoCAD, and Macromedia Flash are used for creating animations. Extensions for animation files include <code>.flv</code>, <code>.gif</code>, etc.
    </p>
