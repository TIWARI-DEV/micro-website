    <h2>1. What is Information Technology? Describe it with its Social Impacts.</h2>
    <p>
        Information Technology (IT) is a modern concept or methodology of communication, combining Information and Communication Technology to facilitate information flow in various fields. IT has made the world closer, enabling instant messaging across the globe. It is widely used in education, industry, banks, research centers, hospitals, and more. In education, IT serves as a learning and teaching tool, making distance learning possible. In industries, IT controls the quantity and quality of products, and in hospitals, it aids in management and patient treatment. IT also enhances animation and entertainment sectors, and it is crucial in scientific research and space technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        While IT has many positive impacts on society, it also has negative aspects. As IT use increases, so do cyber crimes. Cyber criminals can easily steal information, disclose secrets, and spread viruses, disturbing social peace and security.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Security</h2>
    <p>
        In cyberspace, there is always a threat of cyber attacks leading to loss and damage of data. Information security involves protecting network infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or destruction. It includes various physical and software preventive measures to create a secure environment for computers, users, and programs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Information security aims to mitigate security threats and attacks. Security threats are possible dangers that may cause unwanted activities in a computer system, while security attacks are attempts to gain unauthorized access to destroy, expose, steal, or alter valuable data. Common threats include viruses, spyware, Trojan horses, and worms.
    </p>
    <h3>Objectives of Information Security</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized individuals.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Maintaining accuracy and completeness of data, preventing unauthorized tampering.</li>
        <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring information is accessible whenever required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cryptography</h2>
    <p>
        Cryptography, derived from the Greek word meaning “secret writing,” is the art and science of hiding information, providing security for communication. It involves encryption (converting plaintext into an unreadable format) and decryption (converting ciphertext back into readable form). Encryption uses special algorithms and keys, making messages unreadable to unauthorized users.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What is Digital Divide?</h2>
    <p>
        The digital divide refers to the gap between computer-literate and illiterate individuals. It highlights the division between technical and non-technical people in society. Despite the increasing importance of IT, many individuals lack basic computer knowledge and understanding of related terms. This gap is growing, particularly between urban and rural populations, educated and uneducated individuals, and rich and poor communities. The digital divide has become a global issue, prompting governments to work toward bridging this gap.
    </p>

    <h2>3. What are Computer Ethics or Cyber Ethics?</h2>
    <p>
        Computer ethics, or cyber ethics, comprises a set of moral principles or codes of conduct that computer professionals should follow to avoid criminal activities involving computers. Examples of computer ethics include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not use others’ passwords.</li>
        <li>Do not steal others’ information.</li>
        <li>Do not use computers to harm others.</li>
        <li>Do not disclose others’ secrets.</li>
        <li>Do not spread viruses in the network.</li>
        <li>Do not copy licensed software without payment.</li>
        <li>Do not alter others’ data.</li>
        <li>Do not take possession of others’ intellectual property.</li>
        <li>Do not misuse electronic transactions.</li>
        <li>Do not use computers to bear false witness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. What is Cyber Crime? List Some Examples of Cyber Crimes.</h2>
    <p>
        Cyber crime refers to the misuse of computers, the Internet, or other electronic media. As IT use increases, so does the prevalence of cyber crime. Examples of cyber crime include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Misuse of computers.</li>
        <li>Spreading viruses.</li>
        <li>Stealing others’ information.</li>
        <li>Pirating licensed software.</li>
        <li>Disclosing others’ secrets.</li>
        <li>Misuse of electronic transactions and media.</li>
        <li>Posting rude or vulgar comments online.</li>
        <li>Altering data without permission.</li>
        <li>Spying on others’ information.</li>
        <li>Cracking or hacking.</li>
        <li>Password guessing.</li>
        <li>Salami saving and data diddling.</li>
        <li>Forgery.</li>
        <li>Denial of Service (DOS) attacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. What is Cyber Law? Define and Write Some Provisions of It.</h2>
    <p>
        Cyber law refers to the legal framework governing the use of computers and the Internet. It addresses issues related to the misuse of computers, the Internet, and electronic media used for information flow. While cyber ethics suggests avoiding computer crimes, cyber law strictly defines punishments for violations. The Government of Nepal issued the Cyber Law on 11th Falgun, 2061 (March 18, 2005), known as “The Electronic Transaction Ordinance, 2005.”
    </p>
    <h3>Provisions of Cyber Law Include:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Electronic and Digital Signature Law.</li>
        <li>Intellectual Property Law, including Copyright, Trademark, and Patent Laws.</li>
        <li>Telecommunication Law.</li>
        <li>Data Protection and Privacy Law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Explain the Different Objectives of IT Policy of Nepal.</h2>
    <p>
        The IT policies of Nepal aim to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Declare IT as a high-priority sector for the government and make it practical.</li>
        <li>Establish knowledge-based industries to increase employment.</li>
        <li>Make public information and service delivery inclusive and effective through e-government.</li>
        <li>Increase the productive use of IT in social, economic, and business organizations.</li>
        <li>Enhance access to IT-related international developments.</li>
        <li>Make the Government Integrated Data Center (GIDC) effective for IT development infrastructure.</li>
    </ul>
